## 🧪 **How to Execute Smoke Tests**

### **Step 1: Start Application**
```bash
cd /Users/daveabalos/Downloads/Websites/assessly
npm run dev
```
Visit: http://localhost:3000

### **Step 2: Create Test Accounts**
- **Teacher A**: `teacher-a@test.com` / `testpass123`
- **Teacher B**: `teacher-b@test.com` / `testpass123`

### **Step 3: Follow Testing Sequence**

#### **🔥 Critical Path (Must Work)**
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Sign up Teacher A → Dashboard redirect
   - Sign out → Login redirect  
   - Sign in → Dashboard access
   - Create Teacher B account

2. **Core Data Creation**
   - Create Subject: "Mathematics" (MATH)
   - Create Students: Try multiple without Student IDs (our fix!)
   - Create Class: Link to subject and year level
   - Enroll students in class

3. **Assessment & Grading**
   - Create assessment with all fields
   - Open gradebook interface
   - Test keyboard navigation (↑↓, Tab, Enter)
   - Enter scores with auto-save
   - Toggle Draft/Published status

4. **Data Isolation**
   - Teacher B login → sees empty dashboard
   - Cannot access Teacher A's data
   - API security verification

#### **⚡ Advanced Features**
1. **CSV Import**: Download template → Import 5+ students
2. **Mobile Testing**: Test on phone screen size
3. **Performance**: Load times, responsiveness
4. **Reports**: Basic class and student summaries
5. **Announcements**: Create school-wide and class-specific

### **Step 4: Run Automated Tests**

#### **Database Verification**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
-- 1. test_rls_isolation.sql
-- 2. test_audit_log.sql
```

#### **Browser Console Tests**
```javascript
// In browser console, run:
new APISecurityTester().runAllTests()
new PerformanceTester().runAllTests()
runLighthouseChecks()
```
