-- Seed data for ScholarTrack MVP
-- 
-- This file intentionally left minimal to avoid foreign key constraints
-- The application will guide users through creating their first data
-- after signup, ensuring proper owner_id relationships.

-- You can add any static/reference data here that doesn't depend on user IDs
